Loan Approval Predictor
-----------------------

*   Created dataset that predicts whether a loan will be granted to an individual, based on 25 variables, including income and location
*   Used decision tree classification algorithm to train prediction model given dataset and visualize the decision tree in a .txt file
*   Achieved 80% accuracy in predicting loan granting

### **Prerequisites**

*   Python
*   Knowledge about Decision Trees
*   OOPs Programming

### Functionality

*   Used 2 datasets. One for training/testing(accuracy calculation) and second for prediction
*   First Dataset split into train and test datset. Train Dataset helps create the decision tree. Test data is used to calculate accuracy of the model
